-- | A chain of effectful @f@-computations with composite result @a@.
-- Individual computations (lifted into @Effects@ using '*.' below) have their
-- own result types, which fit together in standard 'Applicative' fashion.
-- Although these result types are lost in the composite type, the
-- computations can still be moved around within the list (see 'swap' and
-- 'firsts' in the source code for examples). This allows their permutations
-- to be computed.
